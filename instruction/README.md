This includes the instructions of how to use AdaHessian for your own models and own problems, particularly, for models with different kernel sizes (matrix, 1D Conv, 2D Conv, etc). Line 87 -- 144 in [here](https://github.com/amirgholami/adahessian/blob/master/instruction/adahessian.py) shows how to deal with different kernels. For 1D, 3D, and 4D tensors, we give two choices to set the spatial averaging. For the second way, one thing that needs to be noticed is that one spatial averaging size (i.e., self.block_length) maybe not suitable for all different kernels. For example, self.block_length = 5 cannot be used for 1D (with size 20), 3D (with size 20x20x5) and 4D (with size 256x256x3x3) kernels since 256x256x3x3 cannot be divided by 5. Hence, if you want to use the second way, you may want to use different self.block_length for different kernels.
